This program includes all the files needed to run the project. To run the project successfully, simply click and open the devC++ project file called HealthProfileProject located in the project directory. Note: if you open the files individually (without opening the devC++ project), the program will not compile because devC++ will be looking at each file as a separate entity requiring a main function to work.
